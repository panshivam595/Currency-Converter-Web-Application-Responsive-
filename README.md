# This Currency Converter application allows users to seamlessly convert currencies between different countries in real time. 


Using live exchange rate data, it enables users to input an amount in one currency and convert it to another, with automatic updates and conversion rates pulled from an external API. The application offers a user-friendly interface with the following key features:

Real-Time Conversion: Fetches live exchange rates from the API and updates conversions instantly as users change the input amount or select different currencies.
Currency and Country Selection: Provides a dropdown menu with country flags and currency symbols for easy selection of the source and destination currencies.
Interactive Currency Swap: A simple button lets users swap the 'From' and 'To' currencies.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
Last Update Information: Displays the time of the last update and the time of the next update for exchange rates, ensuring that users receive the most accurate and up-to-date information.
Technologies used in this project include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs for currency exchange and country data. This project showcases my skills in web development, user interface design, and integration with external APIs.
